                            We are a passionate and ambitious group of peers bound by an unbridled spirit of adventure. Despite our urban location, we have seen firsthand how the outdoors offers a unique opportunity for students to come together, regardless of their walk of life or level of skill. Where there is adventure to be had, PathPort is there to share it with our community. Whether you’re a beginner or an old pro, we’d love to have you join us.

                            Our goal is to get as many people outside as possible. Whether you're an experienced mountaineer or have never set foot outside in the concrete jungle of LA, we've got a recommended place for you to explore! So, feel free to browse through our recommendations and explore the places. Please let us know how they were!
